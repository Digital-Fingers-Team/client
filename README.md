## Description

A production-ready web system for managing classrooms, students, and teachers with real-time messaging, file uploads, and a React frontend.

## Project setup

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Fill in your DATABASE_URL, UPLOADS_DIR, and JWT_SECRET in .env

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Seed the database with sample data
npm run seed

# Start the backend application
npm run start:dev
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd client

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm start
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:3000` and the frontend on `http://localhost:3001`.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT
- Role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student)

## Database

This project uses Prisma ORM with SQLite for development. For production, you can switch to PostgreSQL by updating the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file.

## File Uploads

Files are stored locally in the `uploads/` directory. The storage is abstracted for easy migration to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
